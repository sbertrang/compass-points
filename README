    Compass::Points - Convert between compass point names, abbreviations and
    values

SYNOPSIS
      use Compass::Points;
      my $points = Compass::Points->new();
      my $deg = $points->abbr2deg( "NNE" );

DESCRIPTION
    This module converts compass point names and abbreviations to degrees
    and vice versa. It supports four different compass point systems: 4, 8,

METHODS
  new( [ $points ] )
    Returns a Compass::Points object for the number of points (defaults to
    16).

  deg2abbr( $degree )
    Takes a degree value and returns the corresponding abbreviation for the
    matching wind name.

  deg2name( $degree )
    Same as deg2abbr() but returns the full wind name.

  abbr2deg( $abbreviation )
    Given a wind name abbreviation returns the degree of the points object.

  name2deg( $name )
    Same as abbr2deg() but takes full wind names.
